ðŸ§  Project Overview: Image Segmentation Pipeline with Albumentations & Pretrained Models
This project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow for training a deep learningâ€“based image segmentation model using a custom imageâ€“mask dataset. The pipeline is modular, reproducible, and built using best practices in PyTorch.

ðŸ“¦ Key Components
Custom Dataset Class
Implemented a PyTorch-compatible dataset class that loads imageâ€“mask pairs from disk and ensures proper alignment between input images and ground truth masks.

Augmentation Pipeline with Albumentations
Applied powerful, production-ready image and mask augmentations using the Albumentations library to enhance dataset diversity while maintaining pixel-wise correspondence.

Visualization
Visualized augmented imageâ€“mask pairs to ensure transformation integrity and improve debugging during training.

Pretrained Segmentation Backbone
Leveraged state-of-the-art segmentation architectures (e.g., U-Net) from the segmentation_models.pytorch library. These models are initialized with pretrained encoder weights for faster convergence and improved performance.

Training & Evaluation Utilities
Developed modular train() and evaluate() functions to encapsulate core training loop logic. These utilities support batch-wise loss tracking, IoU calculation, and checkpointing.

Model Training
Executed the training loop using the above components to fine-tune the segmentation model on the custom dataset. All steps follow scalable deep learning engineering practices, making the pipeline extensible and robust.
